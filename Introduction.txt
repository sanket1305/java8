-------------------------------------- Java 8 Features -----------------------------------------

1) Lambda Expressions
    Java in Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) Language
    However, Functional Programming Langauge also has some advantage over OOPs Language
    To provide the easy of using Functional Programming Language advantages in Java, Lambda Expression was introduced.
    So we are getting benefits of Functional Programming in Java, by using Lambda Expression

2) Functional Interfaces
    It can be used to call Lambda Expressions

3) Default Methods (In interfaces)
    In the interfaces (till java 7),
        Every mehtod is abstract or public (Whether we are declaring or not)
        Every variable is public, static , final (Whether we are declaring or not)
    In Java 8, 
        You can declare concrete mathods also, those methods are called DEFAULT METHODS

4) Static Methods (In Interface)

5) Predicate 
    Predefined Functional Interface

6) Function
    Predefined Functional Interface

7) Consumer
    Predefined Functional Interface

8) Method Rerference & Constructor Rerference (::)

9) Stream API
    To perform bulk operation on collection, will becaome more easy

10) Date & Time API (Joda API)
    introduced by joda.org and hence also known as Joda API

    Need of Java 8
        1) To simplify java programmming
        2) To utilize functional programming benefits in Java
        3) To enable Parallel Programming (or Parallel Processing) in Java
